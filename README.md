## ⚙️ Requirements

- [CMake >= 3.21](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [GFortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/)
- Make (on Unix-like systems)

---

## 🚀 Build and Run

### 1. Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

or

```bash
cd my_project/
./install.sh
```

The main executable will be generated in:

```
bin/my_exe
```

### 2. Run the Program

```bash
./bin/my_exe
```

or

```bash
cd my_project/
./run.sh
```

Expected output:

```kotlin
========== T4C FORTRAN PROJECT ==========
Physical function result =   10.0000000000000
```

---

## ✅ Tests

This project uses [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html) for automated testing.

### 1. Run Tests:

```bash
cd build
ctest
```

or

```bash
cd my_project/
./test.sh
```

### 2. Expected Output:

```bash
Test project /path/to/build
    Start 1: run_tests
1/1 Test #1: run_tests ..................   Passed
```

## 🔍 Library Description

### 🔧 `libF77/`

Contains legacy utility subroutines (Fortran 77), such as `print_banner`.

### 📐 `modules/`

Contains reusable modern Fortran modules. Example:

```fortran
function model_function(x)
  y = x**2 + 1
```

---

## 🧪 Test Structure

`tests/test.f90` validates `model_function` with a simple case:

```fortran
x = 2.0d0
y = model_function(x)
if (abs(y - 5.0d0) < 1.0d-6) then
   print *, 'Test OK.'
```

---

## 🛠️ Customization

- Add new libraries to `libF77/` or `modules/` and include them in their respective `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Expand the main executable in `src/`.
- Create new tests in `tests/` and register them using `add_test(...)`.
